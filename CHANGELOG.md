- Added Rails project validation (checks for Gemfile or app/ directory)

## [2.3.0] - 2025-09-01

### Added
- **Knowledge Graph**: Complete graph-based code navigation system
  - SQLite-backed graph store with nodes and edges tables
  - Automatic graph population from AST and database schema
  - Support for code relationships: inheritance, module inclusion, method definitions
  - Database relationships: tables, columns, foreign keys, indexes
  - Rails-specific edges: belongs_to, has_many, has_one, backs (modelâ†”table)
- **New Graph Navigation Tools**:
  - `graph_find_nodes` - Search nodes by kind, key, or label
  - `graph_neighbors` - Traverse connected nodes with edge filtering
  - `graph_explain` - Get detailed node information and suggested actions
  - `get_definition` - Retrieve code snippets with context
  - `list_rails` - List Rails associations, validations, and callbacks
- **Graph Builder**: Intelligent graph construction from multiple sources
  - Extracts relationships from Ruby AST
  - Maps database schema to graph nodes
  - Infers model-to-table mappings using Rails conventions
  - Creates bidirectional relationship edges

### Enhanced
- Indexer now populates knowledge graph during AST parsing
- Database schema parsing feeds into graph structure
- Improved relationship tracking between code and database

## [2.2.0] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- **Database Schema Awareness**: Parses `db/schema.rb` to understand database structure
- **New MCP Tools**:

  - `db_table` - Get detailed table information (columns, indexes, constraints)
  - `db_table_relations` - Find foreign key relationships
  - `db_suggest_associations` - Generate Rails associations from foreign keys
- **Rails Association Mapping**: Automatically suggests `belongs_to`, `has_many`, and `has_one` based on foreign keys
- **Validation Generation**: Suggests Rails validations based on database constraints
- **Schema Parser**: Extracts tables, columns, indexes, and foreign keys from schema.rb
- **SQLite Schema Storage**: Stores schema metadata for fast queries

### Changed
- Reindex now automatically parses schema.rb if present
- Enhanced database with schema-specific tables

## [1.0.6] - 2025-08-26
