## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-01

- **No More Failures**: Server connects instantly, even for large Rails projects

### Added
- **Index Status Tracking**: New `get_index_status` tool to check indexing progress
- **Partial Results Warning**: Tools now indicate when indexing is in progress
- **Better Status Reporting**: Track files processed, errors, and completion time

### Improved
